      <h4>Maps with React Leaflet</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some libraries depend on other libraries to work. Read React
          Leaftlet&apos;s documentation carefully to understand what needs to be
          installed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once all libraries are installed, create a file named <b>MyMap.js</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          In this file, use React Leaflet to create a map. It should also have a
          pin at a location of your choosing. The documentation also explains
          how to customize your map.
          <ul>
            <li>
              You component MyMap should be given two props: <i>lng</i> and{' '}
              <i>lat</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              Render this map inside one of the tabs created with react-tabs,
              using the given props to center both map and pin.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
